# Coding Problems

Here you can find [solutions](#Solutions) for various coding/algorithmic problems and many useful [tips]/[patterns](#Learning-Resources) for solving common interview problems.\
Also, this repo will be updated with new solutions and resources from time to time.

*Note that this repo is meant to be used for learning and researching purposes only and it is **not** meant to be used for production.*


## Solutions

All solutions are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) (more precisely, [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3)), using the [Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) (print, len, range, sorted, sum, min, max, etc...) and a few modules from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) like:
- [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) (used for constants like math.pi, math.inf and functions like math.ceil, math.floor, math.gcd, math.log, math.pow, math.sqrt, etc)
- [collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html) (used for [collections.deque](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque) when there is a need for [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) or [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) data structures)
- [heapq](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html) (used when there is a need for [Priority Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) data structure).
- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) (used for [nondeterministic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_algorithm), like shuffling arrays ([Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)), sampling arrays ([Reservoir sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling)) and [Monte Carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)).

So, to execute these solutions there is no need from installing any external packages. \
Coding style and name conventions are described in the official [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) page.

*Note that I'm **not** the author of these problems, they are from sites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) (you can find more than 40 sites like this in the [Training Sites](#Training-Sites) section). **Only** the solutions and explanations are mine.*


### Template

For easier navigation into the solutions, each file with a solution in this repo will have the following template:

```python
'''
Problem Name

Problem explanation.

Input: XXX
Output: XXX
Output explanation: XXX

=========================================
Solution 1 explanation.
    Time Complexity:    O(X)
    Space Complexity:   O(X)
Solution 2 explanation.
(some of the problems are solved in more than one way)
    Time Complexity:    O(X)
    Space Complexity:   O(X)
'''

def name_of_solution_1(params):
    # description of code
    pass


##############
# Solution 2 #
##############

def name_of_solution_2(params):
    # description of code
    pass


###########
# Testing #
###########

# Test 1
# Correct result => 'result1'
test_val = 'example1'
print(name_of_solution_1(test_val))
print(name_of_solution_2(test_val))

# Test 2
# Correct result => 'result2'
test_val = 'example2'
print(name_of_solution_1(test_val))
print(name_of_solution_2(test_val))
```

*Note that here I'm using the **simplest** way of testing, printing the results using the [print](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) method. Why? Because I think that the bigger part of the users of this repo isn't familiar with [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) and I wanted this part to be intuitive. Btw, I strongly recommend using some unit testing framework for this kind of testing. The Python Standard Library contains a **great** framework for unit testing called [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), or you can install some third-party unit testing framework like [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).*
